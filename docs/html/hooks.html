    <h2><a name="Ballista-Hooks-Hooks"></a>Hooks</h2>
    <p>
      Ballista executes hook scripts to which you can add custom commands that will be run on the server before and after a deploy is performed.
    </p>
    <h4><a name="Ballista-Hooks-HooksConfiguration"></a>Hooks Configuration</h4>
    <p>
      The hooks configuration uses the ini file syntax. You can add shell commands here that will be run by the Ballista hooks when deploys are performed. The commands listed in the pre-deploy.ini file will be run on the server before the deploy is performed and the commands listed in post-deploy.ini are run after the deploy is performed. Below you will find a sample configuration example and further down the explanation of the syntax.
    </p>
    <h6><a name="Ballista-Hooks-Availableparameters"></a>Available parameters</h6>
    <p>
      The following variables are available for use in the hook commands.
